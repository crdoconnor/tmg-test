Black grape and red wine sorbet

A refreshingly tannic dessert that’s the perfect foil to a rich, meaty dinner 

This is incredibly easy and has a lovely autumnal flavour. Make sure you make it with fresh grapes for the best possible flavour. It’s an ideal end to a rich meal, perfect after a sticky, meaty braise.

Requires 2 hours chilling time and around 6 hours, 45 minutes freezing time.

Ingredients

    120g granulated sugar
    750g seedless black grapes, removed from their stem
    200ml red wine
    juice of ½-1 lemon, to taste

Method
Step

Gently heat 120g granulated sugar in a pan with 100ml water. Bring to the boil, turn the heat down and simmer for 2 minutes, then leave to cool.
Step

Whizz 750g black seedless grapes (removed from their stem) in a blender to a purée. Pour this through a sieve into a bowl, using a wooden spoon to push through as much as possible.
Step

Stir in the cooled syrup, 200ml red wine and the juice of ½-1 lemon to taste (it gives necessary acidity and ‘brightens’ the flavour of the grapes, but the amount you use depends on the sweetness of the grapes). Taste as you add it and be careful not to overwhelm the flavour of the fruit.
Step

Cover and chill in the fridge for a couple of hours, then churn in an ice-cream machine.
Step

Transfer to a container, cover and freeze for a few hours until firm.
Step

If you don’t have an ice-cream machine, pour the mixture into a shallow, lidded container (preferably metal) and freeze until the mixture firms up around the edges.
Step

Use a fork to beat the ice crystals, then freeze for 45 minutes. Repeat this every 45 minutes for a further 3 hours, then leave to freeze until firm. Serve in glasses.
